This is an utterly simple-minded sample that demonstrates how to use
autotools (autoconf, automake, and libtool).

This project builds two binaries, greet and greet_static.  Both binaries
rely on libhello for the greet() function.  The greet binary links against
a shared library version of libhello, while greet_static links against a static
version of libhello.
